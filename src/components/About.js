            Hi, Iâ€™m Muhammad Younus, a passionate BS Software Engineering
            student with hands-on experience in modern web technologies. I
            recently completed a two-month internship at HBL Microfinance Bank
            (Head Office, Islamabad), where I gained practical exposure to
            professional development environments. I have strong skills in
            React, Tailwind CSS, PrimeReact, MySQL, and Spring Boot, allowing me
            to build dynamic, responsive, and scalable applications. In 2024, I
            also completed a two-month NAVTTC training at Corvit Academy, which
            further strengthened my technical foundation and teamwork abilities.
            I am eager to contribute my skills to real-world projects,
            continuously learn new technologies, and grow as a full-stack
            developer.
